# 2022 January - IBM Neuro-Symbolic AI Workshop

For more information and access to the event recordings, see the full blog [here](https://ibm.github.io/neuro-symbolic-ai/blog/nsai-wkshp-2022-blog/).

Neuro-symbolic AI combines knowledge-driven symbolic AI and data-driven machine learning approaches. In this workshop we will show our recent progress toward some of the most outstanding issues in today's AI:

Incorporation of complex domain knowledge into learning, including ways to ensure trusted behavior -- and vice versa, incorporation of learning to account for incomplete or imperfect knowledge
Rigorous expressive reasoning which is 'soft' (handles uncertainty) while computationally practical
Learning with many fewer examples through the use of knowledge
Full explainability by construction, including the reasons the models make their decisions
Natural language processing via this approach to achieve state-of-the-art results, including handling more complex examples than is possible with today's default AI.
This workshop will include talks from IBM researchers and other academic AI experts. The speakers will share an overview of neuro-symbolic AI technologies, achievements to date, and future direction for the field. The workshop will also include a panel discussion on the future of AI and the possible role of neuro-symbolic AI approaches.

The variety of topics, presentation modalities, and stakeholders will allow the audience of this workshop to reflect on the best path to advance AI in a way that is at the same time scientifically inspiring, economically sustainable, and beneficial to society.
