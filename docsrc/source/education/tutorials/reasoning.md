# Chapter 1 - Reasoning

0. [Propositional Logic](https://github.com/IBM/LNN/blob/master/tutorials/Chapter%201%20-%20Reasoning/0.%20Propositional%20Logic.ipynb)

   - In this notebook, we will demonstrate the task of logical reasoning to evaluate and inspect an LNN graph for the simple propositional scenario.

1. [Propositional Bounds](https://github.com/IBM/LNN/blob/master/tutorials/Chapter%201%20-%20Reasoning/1.%20Propositional%20Bounds.ipynb)

   - In this notebook, we will extend the representation of truth values to improve the expressiveness of logic. These extensions allow LNNs to handle a greater amount of ambiguity and uncertainty of beliefs otherwise present in logical reasoning systems.

2. [Propositional Learning](https://github.com/IBM/LNN/blob/master/tutorials/Chapter%201%20-%20Reasoning/2.%20Propositional%20Learning.ipynb)

   - In the previous notebooks, we've demonstrated how logic can be used to reason about data using knowledge. We've also seen how LNNs extend truth value semantics to include uncertainties and ambiguities about beliefs. However, one of the key advantages of neural networks is their ability to learn from the data and update parameters to achieve some objective. In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how learnable parameters can be included into LNNs and allow for logical consistency to be enforced.
