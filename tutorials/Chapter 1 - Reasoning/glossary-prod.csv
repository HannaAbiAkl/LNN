By law, the appointments must yield a 'fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests and geographical divisions of the country,' and no two Governors may come from the same Federal Reserve District.

The full term of a Governor is 14 years; appointments are staggered so that one term expires on January 31 of each even-numbered year. A Governor who has served a full term may not be reappointed, but a Governor who was appointed to complete the balance of an unexpired term may be reappointed to a full 14-year term.

Once appointed, Governors may not be removed from office for their policy views. The lengthy terms and staggered appointments are intended to contribute to the insulation of the Board--and the Federal Reserve System as a whole--from day-to-day political pressures to which it might otherwise be subject.

In addition to serving as members of the Board, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Board serve terms of four years, and they may be reappointed to those roles and serve until their terms as Governors expire. The Chairman serves as public spokesperson and representative of the Board and manager of the Board's staff. The Chairman also presides at Board meetings.

Securities and Exchange Commission,NamedIndividual,US Regulatory Agencies Ontology,,"independent commission established by the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934 whose mission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation",,,"The SEC oversees the key participants in the securities world, including securities exchanges, securities brokers and dealers, investment advisors, and mutual funds. Here the SEC is concerned primarily with promoting the disclosure of important market-related information, maintaining fair dealing, and protecting against fraud.
     Crucial to the SEC's effectiveness in each of these areas is its enforcement authority. Each year the SEC brings hundreds of civil enforcement actions against individuals and companies for violation of the securities laws. Typical infractions include insider trading, accounting fraud, and providing false or misleading information about securities and the companies that issue them.
     One of the major sources of information on which the SEC relies to bring enforcement action is investors themselves - another reason that educated and careful investors are so critical to the functioning of efficient markets. To help support investor education, the SEC offers the public a wealth of educational information on this Internet website, which also includes the EDGAR database of disclosure documents that public companies are required to file with the Commission.
     Though it is the primary overseer and regulator of the U.S. securities markets, the SEC works closely with many other institutions, including Congress, other federal departments and agencies, the self-regulatory organizations (e.g. the stock exchanges), state securities regulators, and various private sector organizations. In particular, the Chairman of the SEC, together with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, serves as a member of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets.",release

autonomous agent,Class,Agents Ontology,,An agent is an autonomous individual that can adapt to and interact with its environment.,,,"Agents, then, can be software agents, hardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents, and so on.  While software developers naturally think of IT systems as being constructed of only software agents, a combination of agent mechanisms might in fact be used from shop-floor manufacturing to warfare systems.  The definition incorporated herein must be sufficiently general to account for these and other uses, such as for describing people and organizations who participate in broader processes and systems, for FIBO, other OMG standards and usage, and in general.

Whether or not you restrict your view of agents to the software variety, most agree that agents deployed for IT systems are not useful without the following three important properties:

(1) Autonomous - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention.  Agents have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and processing that enable them to act without any external choreography.  When an agent acts on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing, its autonomy is expected to embody the goals and policies of the entity that it represents.

(2) Interactive - an agent communicates with the environment and other agents. Agents are interactive entities because they are capable of exchanging rich forms of messages with other entities in their environment.  These messages can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification.  They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature.  The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query.

(3) Adaptive - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to messages and events and then respond appropriately.  Agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences.  They can learn and evolve.. Note that this does not necessarily imply that an agent is free to act as it sees fit, without constraint. Rather, an autonomous thing in the sense meant here is something which may or may not be subject to controls and constraints but is self-actualizing in its behavior in response to any such constraints. Autonomous things may include human beings, organizations, software agents, robots and animals.",release

Also, since the contracts are not exchange traded, there is no mark-to-market requirement, which allows a buyer to avoid almost all capital outflow initially (though some counterparties might set collateral requirements). The forward price makes the forward contract have no value when the contract is written. However, if the value of the underlying commodity changes, the value of the forward contract becomes positive or negative, depending on the position held. Forwards are priced in a manner similar to futures. Like in the case of a futures contract, the first step in pricing a forward is to add the spot price to the cost of carry (interest forgone, convenience yield, storage costs and interest/dividend received on the underlying). Unlike a futures contract though, the price may also include a premium for counterparty credit risk, and the fact that there is not daily marking to market process to minimize default risk.

Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily.

A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single 'figure of merit' for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful 'average' to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5).",release

It has shareholders with limited liability and its shares may not be offered to the general public, unlike those of public limited companies. Limited by shares means that the company has shareholders, and that the liability of the shareholders to creditors of the company is limited to the capital originally invested, i.e. the nominal value of the shares and any premium paid in return for the issue of the shares by the company. A shareholders personal assets are thereby protected in the event of the companys insolvency, but money invested in the company will be lost. A limited company may be private or public.

The construction of this index can be thought of in terms of selecting a basket of goods and services representative of base-period revenues, valuing this at base-period prices, and then repricing the same basket at current-period prices. The target PPI in this case is defined to be the ratio of these two revenues. Practicing statisticians use this methodology because it has at least three practical advantages. It is easily explained to the public, it can use often expensive and untimely weighting information from the date of the last (or an even earlier) survey or administrative source (rather than requiring sources of data for the current month), and it need not be revised if users accept the Laspeyres premise.. Statistical agencies implement the Laspeyres index by putting it into price-relative (price change from the base period) and revenue-share (from the base period) format. In this form, the Laspeyres index can be written as the sum of base-period revenue shares of the items in the index times their corresponding price relatives. Statistical agency practice has introduced some approximations to the theoretical Laspeyres target due to a number of practical problems with producing the Laspeyres index exactly. For these and other pragmatic reasons, some agencies use alternatives depending on circumstances. See the IMF publication cited for a full explanation of the most commonly used approaches and trade-offs made for determining PPI.",release
